QNAPPY
======

qnappy is a Python-based control script for the QNAP line of low-end NAS
products. Before using it, here's a few tidbits:

- It is being developed on a TS-219; if your hardware is different, YMMV
- It may or may not keep my NAS from running hot.  But much like defragging
  and Apple's Time Machine, it juts feels good to use it.

Requirements
============

- A compatible NAS

- A normal Linux variant that provides TTY's and evdev support (not sure if
  the stock firmware is any good for this)

- The [evdev python module][evdev]

- The [serial python module][serial], available on debian and ubuntu as
  python-serial

Usage
=====

To test qnappy, go to the directory where it is stored run it as root:

[user@host qnappy]$ sudo ./qnappy 

You should see output like this:

  $ sudo ./qnappy 

2011-05-24 14:53:49,871 - qnappy.qcontrol.QNAP TS-219 - INFO - Temp: 42 [low] => fan silence
2011-05-24 14:53:49,873 - qnappy.qcontrol.QNAP TS-219 - INFO - Setting status to fan_silence
2011-05-24 15:03:17,301 - qnappy.qcontrol.QNAP TS-219 - INFO - Temp: 45 [med] => fan low
2011-05-24 15:03:17,302 - qnappy.qcontrol.QNAP TS-219 - INFO - Setting status to fan_low

Most of which is a lot of debug crap.

Notes
=====

I don't really know what the optimal temperatures should be for these
devices. I made some wild guesses as to how the fans should spin on which
readings from the PIC.

Also, the evdev code seems to be a bit buggy.  Don't expect this to run
very long if you've got a mouse on the port and you're monkeying around with
it.
