QNAPPY
======

qnappy is a Python-based control script for the QNAP line of low-end NAS
products. Before using it, here's a few tidbits:

- It is being developed on a TS-219; if your hardware is different, YMMV
- It may or may not keep my NAS from running hot.  But much like defragging
  and Apple's Time Machine, it juts feels good to use it.

Requirements
============

- A compatible NAS

- A normal Linux variant that provides TTY's and evdev support (not sure if
  the stock firmware is any good for this)

- The [evdev python module][evdev]

- The [serial python module][serial], available on debian and ubuntu as
  python-serial

Usage
=====

To test qnappy, go to the directory where it is stored run it as root:

[user@host qnappy]$ sudo ./qnappy 

You should see output like this:

  $ sudo ./qnappy 
  <Device name='Live! Cam Optia' axes={} buttons={}>
  <Device name='gpio-keys' axes={} buttons={}>
  [1300923146.470256] Current temperature: 42
  Temp: 42 [low] => fan silence
  Setting status to fan_silence
  [1300923146.910189] Status: FAN1_NORMAL
  [1300923146.910557] Status: FAN2_NORMAL
  [1300923151.490213] Current temperature: 43

Most of which is a lot of debug crap.

qnappy monitors evdev devices for different events.  If you plug something
in, it should notice it.  The events will be available.  Since the QNAP is
basically a black box with no inputs, this can be useful.

Notes
=====

I don't really know what the optimal temperatures should be for these
devices. I made some wild guesses as to how the fans should spin on which
readings from the PIC.

Also, the evdev code seems to be a bit buggy.  Don't expect this to run
very long if you've got a mouse on the port and you're monkeying around with
it.
